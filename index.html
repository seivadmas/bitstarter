          <p>Hi, my name is Patrick Kedziora and I'm the founder of Kedzoh.</p>
          <p>As you can tell, I have a difficult last name and my entire life I've believed that difficult things should be made easy. I believe that all employees can make a difference; I believe that Human Resources <b>can</b> have an impact and I believe that good managers strive to be leaders.</p>
          <p>I've worked in both large and small companies - and one thing I noticed was that wherever I worked, training always seemed far more complicated than it had to be.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we'd make the mistake of hiring expensive outside consultants to try to speed things up. But that usually didn't help much, and by the end of it we'd be left with without much to show for it except a huge bill.</p>
          <p>But when we kept training in-house, everything took forever to get done. We'd have endless meetings to discuss and explain the content, then more meetings to get management approval, and even when we were ready, just getting everybody in the same room together at the same time proved to be a real challenge.</p>
          <p>Often by the time we actually managed to push a lesson through, the knowledge was already outdated - and after the session was over and everyone had gone home, we'd be left wondering whether anybody had really understood the key points.</p>
          <p>In the end I couldn't take it any more - I finally quit out of sheer frustration. I just knew there <b>had</b> to be a better way of sharing knowledge within a company.</p>
          <p>Let's face facts - the corporate world is rapidly going mobile. Employees and teams are often scattered across the globe, and we don't always have the luxury of being able to bring them all together for in-person training. But there is one thing we all have with us, all the time...</p>
          <p><b>A phone.</b></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row-fluid section2">
        <div class="span5 offset1 copy copy-right">
          <p>Think back for a moment to the last time you walked out of your front door - what did you make SURE you had with you before you headed out?</p>
          <p>Your keys, your wallet... <b>and your phone.</b></p>
          <p>Wherever we are, wherever we go, we always take our phone with us.</p>
          <p>And that's where I got the inspiration for Kedzoh.</p>
          <p>Kedzoh is an application for smartphones and tablets that lets you <b>take, create and share</b> simple, 3 to 5 minutes lessons throughout your company. Lessons that are content-rich and can include video, text, pictures, audio and drawings.</p>
          <p>But what's more, lessons can also include quizzes - so if you're an administrator, you'll know exactly who took the lessons and can be sure that they understood the key points.</p>
          <p>Imagine for a second: you're rolling out a promotion on a new product, and you need to get all of your sales people up to speed on the details. They might be spread across hundeds of stores or different parts of the country - but with Kedzoh, you can reach them all with the right information within seconds, right here on your phone.</p>
          <p>Or you held a training session on mining safety a week ago, and want to check that all of your field technicians are completely on board with the latest procedures. Simply create a lesson, hit send and look over the test scores later. You can have peace of mind being sure that everyone got the important points.</p>
          <p>Or you've been experiencing some problems with the conveyor at your manufacturing plant. With Kedzoh, your engineers can pull up a step-by-step guide on how to fix it on their phone, on site. We know that not all areas have full mobile coverage, that's why Kedzoh runs as a native app. This means it also works while offline, so you can view the lessons you need even in areas with no signal.</p>
          <p>Kedzoh lets you share knowledge instantly with your people, wherever they might be.</p>
          <p>And you know what the best part is?</p>
          <p><b>Anyone</b> can create a lesson with Kedzoh - so your loval managers and remote workers can share the answers to common problems with their team-mates, in real time.</p>
          <p>That's true peer-to-peer learning, or what we call in old school terms: teamwork.</p>
          <p>I believe in making things easy. Our goal is to give you a mobile tool that is so easy to use, it simply fades into the background, leaving you and your people free to focus on what really matters - whether it be learning, sharing... or leading.</p>
          <p>Kedzoh is a learning, management and leadership tool for mobiles. It's the simplest way to communicate key procedures and ideas between team members, and make sure everyone understands. And, in case you hadn't guessed it by now... Kedzoh is also a simple way to say my last name - and that means I personally stand behind it.</p>
          <p><b>So visit us at Kedzoh.com, and we'll be happy to explain how mobile learning could give you back time to learn, manage and lead.</b></p>
